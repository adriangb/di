`di` is a modern dependency injection toolkit, modeled around the simplicity of FastAPI's dependency injection.

Key features:

- **Intuitive**: simple API, inspired by [FastAPI].
- **Auto-wiring**: `di` supports auto-wiring using type annotations.
- **Scopes**: inspired by [pytest scopes], but defined by users (no fixed "request" or "session" scopes).
- **Composable**: decoupled internal APIs give you the flexibility to customize wiring, execution and binding.
- **Performant**: `di` can execute dependencies in parallel and cache results ins scopes. Performance critical parts are written in [ü¶Ä] via [graphlib2].

## Installation

```shell
pip install di[anyio]
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a work in progress. Until there is 1.X.Y release, expect breaking changes. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Simple Example

Here is a simple example of how `di` works:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from di import Container
from di.dependent import Dependent
from di.executors import SyncExecutor


class A:
    ...


class B:
    ...


@dataclass
class C:
    a: A
    b: B


def main():
    container = Container()
    executor = SyncExecutor()
    solved = container.solve(Dependent(C, scope="request"), scopes=["request"])
    with container.enter_scope("request") as state:
        c = solved.execute_sync(executor=executor, state=state)
    assert isinstance(c, C)
    assert isinstance(c.a, A)
    assert isinstance(c.b, B)
```

### Why do I need dependency injection in Python? Isn't that a Java thing?

Dependency injection is a software architecture technique that helps us achieve [inversion of control] and [dependency inversion] (one of the five [SOLID] design principles).

It is a common misconception that traditional software design principles do not apply to Python.
As a matter of fact, you are probably using a lot of these techniques already!

For example, the `transport` argument to httpx's Client ([docs](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#custom-transports)) is an excellent example of dependency injection. Pytest, arguably the most popular Python test framework, uses dependency injection in the form of [pytest fixtures].

Most web frameworks employ inversion of control: when you define a view / controller, the web framework calls you! The same thing applies to CLIs (like [click]) or TUIs (like [Textual]). This is especially true for many newer web frameworks that not only use inversion of control but also dependency injection. Two great examples of this are [FastAPI] and [BlackSheep].

For a more comprehensive overview of Python projects related to dependency injection, see [Awesome Dependency Injection in Python].

## Project Aims

This project aims to be a dependency injection toolkit, with a focus on providing the underlying dependency injection functionality for other libraries.

In other words, while you could use this as a standalone dependency injection framework, you may find it to be a bit terse and verbose.

There are also much more mature standalone dependency injection frameworks:

I would recommend at least looking into [python-dependency-injector] since it is currently the most popular / widely used of the bunch.

Also, if you need no to use scopes, wirings and other advanced tools you can try [fast-depends] too. This project allows you to validate all function parameters by [pydantic] and use a **Depends** (same as [FastAPI]), that should be enought for the most widely cases.
